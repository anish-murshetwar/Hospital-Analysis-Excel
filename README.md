# Hospital Analysis (Excel)

A simple Excel dashboard for hospital data with dynamic tables and visualizations controlled by macros and Power Pivot.

What this repo contains
- Main dashboard summarizing hospital KPIs and trends.
- Four tables on the dashboard, each connected to its own charts/visualizations.
- Dynamic behavior implemented using macros to update or interact with visuals.
- Power Pivot (Data Model) used for calculations and aggregations.

How to open & refresh
1. Open the workbook in Microsoft Excel (Excel 2016 or later recommended).
2. Enable content and data connections.
3. Enable macros (required for the dashboard's dynamic interactions) — only enable if you trust the file.
4. Refresh model: Data → Refresh All to update Power Pivot and charts.
5. Use the dashboard controls to interact with the tables and charts.

Notes
- Four tables are linked to different visualizations and updated dynamically via macros.
- Keep sensitive patient or PII data out of the public repo; anonymize sample data.
